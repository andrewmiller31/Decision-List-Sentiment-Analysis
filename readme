I reformatted the data so that there is a test file with 200 reviews, one review per line.
This file is called sentiment-test.txt. Ther are 100 positive and 100 negative reviews. 
The gold standard classes for these reviews are found in sentiment-gold.txt

There is a training file with 592 negative reviews and 594 positive reviews, for a total
of 1,186 reviews. These are found in sentiment-traing.txt.

The first first in both the training and test file is the identifier, which is the file
name of the review as found in the original data. The second field in the training
data is the correct class (1 = positive, 0 = negative). The second field in the
test data is __.
